# Observations for Belote Project

## General Notes
- The original codebase mixed UI, business logic, and data access in single classes.
- Significant refactoring was done to adhere to SOLID principles and a layered architecture.

## Implementation Details
- We introduced new packages: `domain`, `repository`, `service`, `ui`.
- We replaced direct SQL manipulations in UI classes with repository classes.

## Potential Future Improvements
- Consider transitioning to a more modern UI framework (JavaFX or web-based).
- Additional error handling and better logging frameworks (SLF4J/Log4j).
- Implementation of unit tests with JUnit and mock frameworks such as Mockito.

## Known Issues / WIP
- Hard-coded environment variables for database location. This might be replaced by a config system or environment config in future releases.
- No robust user authentication and role-based management for different user types (if required in scope).
